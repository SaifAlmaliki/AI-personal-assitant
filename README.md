# Personal-Assitant by python and Jarvis

J.A.R.V.I.S is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered Home Assistant (bot) that can help you enjoy a 'smarter home' just by interacting with it in the most natural way!

# The features I want to have are:

- Recognize spoken voice (Speech recognition)
- Answer in spoken voice (Text to speech)
- Answer simple commands

# What powers J.A.R.V.I.S?

The most important technologies at the core of J.A.R.V.I.S


# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Google Assistant

J.A.R.V.I.S is powered by Google Assistant - the industry leading NLP (Natural Language Processing) service. J.A.R.V.I.S employs a server side script (PHP) that is connected to Google Assistant.


# Machine Learning (ML)

Scripts, APIs & Webhooks

J.A.R.V.I.S is powered by Machine Learning (ML) - an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that empowers systems with the ability to automatically learn from its own experiences or mistakes, and improve itself without being ‘re-programmed’ again and again. J.A.R.V.I.S employs several scripts, APIs & webhooks (Python, PHP, C++, HTML) to leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence.


# Face Tracking

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)

J.A.R.V.I.S is an adorable robot that looks at you when you are around. The face tracking is made possible by a python software library - OpenCV.


# Internet of Things (IoT)

Firebase

J.A.R.V.I.S can communicate instantly with other devices at home. Firebase allows J.A.R.V.I.S to quickly communicate with you and your family members through its companion mobile app.


# Mini Computers

Raspberry Pi, Arduino UNO

J.A.R.V.I.S is powered by a set of mini computers. The bot runs on a handful of computers (One Raspberry Pi and a couple of Arduinos) the size of your palm, yet very powerful.
